Point Clouds
============

The plans to tackle the point cloud task is as follow:

1. Prepare and render a still image (from Blender) in a RGBD format [*]
2. Write a GLSL shader to show this data in the BGE
3. Prepare and render an animated sequence (from Blender) in a RGBD format [*]
4. Get the animation to work in the BGE
5. Get the animation to work with audio syncing
6. Try to convert the data from Kinect into a RGBD format compatible with the above plan

[*] - no real data here, just assuming we can convert the Kinect format to image files, to be tackled in (7).
