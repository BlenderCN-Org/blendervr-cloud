Point Clouds
============

The plans to tackle the point cloud task is as follow:

1. Prepare and render an animated sequence (from Blender) in a RGBD format [*]
2. Write a rough GLSL shader to show this data in the BGE
3. Get the animation to work in the BGE
4. Get the animation to work with audio syncing
5. Try to convert the data from Kinect into a RGBD format compatible with the above plan
6. Figure how to handle the difference in resolution between the RGB and D channels
7. Prepare the final GLSL shader

[*] - no real data here, just assuming we can convert the Kinect format to image files, to be tackled in (7).
